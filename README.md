# Entity Component System 101

In 2018, Unity unveiled the Entity Component System as part of DOTS, the Data Oriented Tech Stack. In 2023 we finally have version 1.0 of the [Entities package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.0/manual/index.html).

In this repository I'm doing my best to teach the basics of ECS in the context of Unity. 

If you have only 1 minute, click on the infographic below to learn the very basics of the Entity Component System pattern.
